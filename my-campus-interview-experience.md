# My Campus Interview Experience at ConnectWise 🚀

## 📅 Online Test – 10th January 2025
The first round was an **online coding test**, which included three questions of varying difficulty levels:
- 🟢 **Easy**
- 🟠 **Medium**
- 🔴 **Hard**

## 📜 Coding Test Questions

### **Question 1: Dictatorial Array**
An array of size `n` is said to be **dictatorial** if there exists an element with frequency greater than `n/2` in the array.

Geek has an array `A[]`, and he can perform the following operation any number of times:
- Choose a number `x` in `A[]`, and change all occurrences of `x` to any integer `y`.

Find the **minimum number of operations** Geek needs to perform in order to make the array dictatorial.

---

### **Question 2: Minimum Subarray Length**
Geek has an array `A[]` of `n` elements. You need to determine the **minimum subarray length** starting from index `i` such that the sum of the
subarray is **strictly greater than 6**. You need to calculate this length for all `i` in the range `1` to `N`. If no such subarray exists, return `0`.

### **Question 3: Redistributing Values in a Tree**
You are given a tree `T` with `n` nodes, represented by a 2D array `edges[][]`, where each element specifies an edge between two nodes in the tree.

Initially, each node holds a value equal to its node number. Your task is to **redistribute these values** across the nodes such that no node retains its original value.

You need to determine the following:
1. The **smallest possible sum of the distances** between the initial and final positions of all values after redistribution.
2. The **largest possible sum of the distances** between the initial and final positions of all values after redistribution.

The test mainly assessed problem-solving and coding skills.
